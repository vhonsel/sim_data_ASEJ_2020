# Evaluation of Simulation Results

1. Open cc_graph_analysis_ext.R from the analysis folder. 
2. Edit the path and savedir variable. The path should lead to the "SimSE_Data" folder and the savedir should lead to the "plots" folder.
3. Run the R script. All results will be shown in your R environment and all plots will be saved in the directory.
